Files are arranged into a static format such as `<PREFIX>/<project>/Results/<source_site>/`.... PREFIX acts like a parent directory on a given cluster. To use the files on a different cluster, just recursively copy the files under PREFIX on another system cluster to your PREFIX of choice and update PREFIX.
